    <h2>THINGS THAT WENT WELL</h2>
    <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" ;">I came to school with my mom and sister, it was exciting seeing the campus and the area around it. We had our first assembly where we were given our first set of rules and instructions to guide us on our journey, we heard from the alumnus who gave us advice on how we can go about on some things. 
    in the following days we had our first classes where we were introduced to the teachers, and in each class there was a TA to help us through things if we didn't understand some things. </p>
    <p>I came to realize all the meals were balanced and well cooked and there was no definite menu so everyday it changed which was nice as it was better than the meals I've ate in most schools. I also enjoyed the weekends as we were able to rest in and get ready for the next week.</p>

    <h3> Other things are; </h3>
    <ol> 
<li> Doing my first code.</li>
<li>For the first time being able to understand some terms in coding.</li>
<li>Making some friends.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>THINGS THAT DIDN`T GO WELL</h2>
    <P>I realized that I have developed a bad headache during the weekend which I decided to drink a lot of water, and rest enough but it still persisted to the weekdays and I had to take panadol which is something I didn't want my body to get used of. </P>
    <p> I struggled with managing my sleep schedule which i am still working on till today</p>

    <h3>Some things that didn`t go well</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sleeping through my alarm.</li>
        <li>My skirt tearing on a nail.</li>
        <li>My water bottle deforming because of hot water.</li>
    </ul>
